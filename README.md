## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scipy (for statistical tests)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

## Usage

1. Ensure the `dataset-uci.xlsx` file is in the same directory as the script
2. Run the script:
```bash
python analyze_gallstone_data.py
```

The script will generate all visualizations and provide a detailed analysis of the data in the console output. The analysis includes statistical tests, correlation analysis, and visualizations to help understand the patterns and relationships in the data.

## Key Findings

From the analysis, several patterns emerge that may be relevant to understanding gallstone development:

- Patients with gallstones tend to have higher BMI, especially as age increases
- There are gender-specific patterns in gallstone prevalence, with differences in age of occurrence
- Metabolic factors like high triglycerides, cholesterol, and glucose levels show correlations with gallstone presence
- Visceral fat appears to be more strongly associated with gallstones than overall body fat percentage
- Comorbidities like hyperlipidemia and diabetes show significant associations with gallstone development

These findings highlight the multifactorial nature of gallstone disease and suggest potential avenues for preventive interventions.
